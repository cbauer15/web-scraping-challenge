# web-scraping-challenge
To start this homework we used Jupyter Notebook to build the inital code for webscrapping.
We then transferred this code to a .py file so it can run in a continous string/interface with our app.
We then build a Flask App to interface with our new .py file which allows for use to perform the webscrape and display our results in an HTML.
This HTML that is formatted using bootstrap/CSS.
